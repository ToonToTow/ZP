Slay the Spire, the base game is not a multiplayer game, fortunately it does support mods!

One of the best mods for Slay the Spire is - Spire with Friends!
Spire with friends offers multiplayer co-op capabilities to the game. The mod is very easy to set up and it adds a different aspect of strategy to the game.

#### Spire with friends gameplay
You and up to 5 other players share a map and play simultaneously. You can help your fellow players by sending cards to each other or you can do your own things. There's new boss relics that increase health pools, gold etc for all the players! There's even a different mode which is a race for whoever wins first.
