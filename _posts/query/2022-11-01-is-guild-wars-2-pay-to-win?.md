Pay to win would mean that you can gain a significant advantage over other players by using real world money.

You can buy Gems with real world money in GW2. Gems are used to buy cosmetic and QoL services, most of which are nice but you do not feel hamstrung for lacking them.
One could buy gems, convert into gold and buy gear with gold but it's easy and fast enough to progress in the game that spending money to gems to gold is not reasonable and very expensive.

P2W aspects in GW2 are minimal to the point most would agree it doesn't have any. Worst aspect of its monetization method is that they cycle items in and out of their shop which creates FOMO (fear of missing out).
