PUBG mobile still has a huge player base that makes it a worthwhile (and free) game to play.

### How is it compared to earlier years?
It's not as popular as it once was but it has trended up since they mass banned bots.

### How are queue times?
Queue times are quite fast with queues in new events being instantenious.



### What about updates?
PUBG mobile gets constant updates with new and exciting content.
