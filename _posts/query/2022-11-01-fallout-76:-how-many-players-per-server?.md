In Fallout 76, there can be a maximum of 24 players on a single server at any given time. However, keep in mind that this number may vary depending on the platform you are playing on, as well as any server-specific settings that may be in place. Additionally, there may also be non-player characters (NPCs) in the game world that you can interact with.
