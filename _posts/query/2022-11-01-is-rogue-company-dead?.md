Rogue Company is not dead, it does have a small and dedicated player base that is unfortunately dwindling. There's no real growth in the playerbase, in fact the game is losing players despite being cross play.

### How are queue times?
The queue times do take 20 seconds to 2-3 minutes at worst. You'll often end up playing with the same players over and over.


### Which servers are active.
The NA and EU servers are populated just fine and you will be able to quickly find a game. While the asian server does seem to be dead.

### Is Rogue Company worth playing?
The game is definitely worth a shot. It is free after all. But it is on life support and very unlikely to have a big growth in the playerbase.
