Pay to win would mean that you can gain a significant advantage over other players by using real world money.

Warframe is not pay to win. It is pay to progress a bit faster but that progress can be quickly grinded if you choose not to pay. 

In a hypothetical battle between two players at similar points in the game's progression, about the only thing the 'paid' player will have different is their skins, even then, the free to players might even have more cosmetics if they spend time grinding specifically for platinum, since you can trade for the premium currency and actually get it at a decent rate with relatively simple effort.

You can pay to get a weapon early, or to get upgrade items early, but these do not give you an advantage you couldn't get with some effort without paying, and the amount of effort required is not tremendous.
