The game has a small but very dedicated and loyal player base which will definitely sustain it for at least a few years.

### Community
Since the community is made of mostly older, more experienced at the game players, some of them can be very toxic. Expect to die a lot until you get a hang of it :).

### Voice chat
A lot of players have reported problems with in-game voice chat, for the majority of the players, VC has not worked in months and it seems unlikely that a fix will come in the future as the game will not be getting new updates.


### Is Rising Storm 2: Vietman worth it?
It definitely is worth a try if you like the genre and/or setting. The game goes often on sale and has been given away for free a few times by Epic Games. Care notice, if you decide to try it, avoid the megaservers as they are known for fake playercounts and running malware in the past.
