Ready or Not is a  tactical, first-person shooter with the goal of completing SWAT missions. In missions you will have to deal with a constantly changing chaotic situation where you will detain civilians, help them and move them to safety while combating dangerous and aggressive suspects.

#### Gameplay
Ready or Not at it's core its a PvE game. Players join together to fight AI in various SWAT scenarios. You can play the missions solo, with random players and/or with friends. The gameplay is very realistic, making it very immersive for one to take control of a Human Rescue Team. It is quite challenging to master a mission and pass it with good grades. Gameplay has a lot of variety and the missions very replayable.

#### Development
The game is still in early access and isn't expected to be fully out soon. The game does have small bugs but in the vast majority of the cases they won't alter gameplay or be game breaking. Nonetheless the developers are constantly pushing bug fixes, new content, new maps etc.

#### Community
The community is generally good, you will find toxic teammates or players who troll but they are fairly rare, especially in comparison to other multiplayer games. If you want clean missions it is recommended to play solo or with a friend. Maybe even join the RoN discord server! The modding community is also quite strong with lots of good options to add to your game.

#### Conclusion
Ready or Not is a very good game and it's definitely worth it. It does not go on sale often but even at full price it is a good deal. You will definitely enjoy it if you like similar games such as SWAT 4.
