The game has 3 different acts, each act has it's own bosses, fight encounters and events. Each act has a map like the image below.
You will choose which paths/encounters from the map you want to take. You can look to strengthen your deck, your character or maybe take a rest and fill your hp!

Each encounter gives different rewards such as relics, cards, gold or the option to rest or upgrade your cards! There's events which give you choices such as getting more gold, increasing your max hp or even more game-altering decisions such as replacing cards in your deck with random cards.  You can also enter shops where you can buy cards, potions, relics or even remove cards from your deck.
