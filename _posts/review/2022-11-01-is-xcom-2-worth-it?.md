XCOM 2 is a turn-based strategy game in which you play as the commander of the eponymous organization. Your goal is to defeat the alien threat that has taken over Earth and taken control of most of the population. To do this, you'll need to manage your resources wisely and lead a team of soldiers into battle against the aliens. Each turn, you'll be able to move your soldiers around the battlefield and give them orders, such as telling them to take cover or attack the enemy. As you progress through the game, you'll be able to research new technologies, recruit new soldiers, and upgrade your base. You must carefully plan out your soldiers' movements and attacks, using their unique abilities and weapons to defeat the aliens. The game offers a challenging and engaging experience for players who enjoy strategy games.

XCOM 2 is definitely worth it, it goes often on sale for quite cheaply.
