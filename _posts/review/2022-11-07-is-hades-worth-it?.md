### Content
Although the gameplay is fun and the different weapons allow for unique experiences throughout the game, if you don't like replaying content then this game would likely not be for you.

### Conclusion
Hades is definitely worth it. It's one of the best games in the market in terms of gameplay and story. If you personally dislike roguelite, maybe this game isn't for you but I would still recommend checking it out because it truly is worth the chance that this roguelite's experience is different from all the others for you.
