Victoria II is a very well received grand strategy game that focuses on world history during the 19th and early 20th centuries. It is considered to be a challenging but rewarding game that offers a deep and complex gameplay experience. Many players enjoy the game's intricate political and economic systems, as well as its detailed historical events and scenarios.

In Victoria 2, players assume the role of a leader of a country and must guide it through the tumultuous events of the 19th and early 20th centuries. This involves making strategic decisions on a variety of fronts, including diplomacy, trade, and military conflict.

Players can engage in diplomatic activities with other countries, forming alliances and negotiating treaties. They can also engage in trade with other nations, importing and exporting goods to and from their own country. Military conflict is also a possibility in the game, and players can build and manage their own armies and navies, and engage in battles with other countries.

In addition to these core gameplay mechanics, Victoria 2 also features a detailed economic and political system, allowing players to manage their country's economy and political system, and make decisions that will shape its future. This can include things like investing in infrastructure, enacting new laws and policies, and responding to events and crises that arise throughout the game.

### Gameplay
The game play great, it's so intricate and everything overlaps. The smallest things have a butterfly effect and change the whole game, making new saves very different, keeping the game fresh and unique.

### Is Victoria 2 difficult?
The game's complexity is one of its main selling points, as it allows for a high degree of strategic depth and allows players to make meaningful decisions that will have a lasting impact on their country's development. However, this complexity can also be off-putting for some players, who may find it overwhelming or frustrating.

### Victoria 2 without DLC's?
House Divided and Heart of Darkness are not optional DLCs: The game is incomplete without them. You will have to pay a bit more but the DLC's are definitely worth it.

### Conclusion
If you enjoy grand strategy games and have an interest in the Victorian era, then Victoria II is worth getting. Keep in mind, however, that the game can be challenging to learn especially if it's your first game of this genre. If you do choose to try Victoria 2, make sure that you also get both of the DLC's.
