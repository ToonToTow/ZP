Victoria III is a grand strategy game that focuses on world history during the 19th and early 20th centuries. It is quite a lot of fun and much more new-player-friendly commpared to Victoria 2.

Unfortunately the tutorial is not very good at the moment, so you'll have to look around for information helping you learn the game.

It's enjoyable to figure out the economy the first time, and maybe even to get it right from the start the second save, but it's the same routine every time you play. The AI is not challenging enough to provide any resistance.

There are quite a few bugs and UI inconsistencies which players are reporting to Paradox to fix on upcoming patches.

### Conclusion
If you are a BIG Vicky 2 fan, definitely worth a try otherwise at the current price and stage of development, we would recommend to wait on a sale and/or bugfixes and game balance patches.
