Diablo 3, the action RPG has definitely improved quite a lot since it's launch. At this point it's worth getting if you like the particular game genre.

### Is Diablo 3 the game for you?
Of the Diablo titles, Diablo 3 is quite casual-friendly. You can play as short as you want - particularly in seasonal and/or adventure mode, you can make progress in as little as 10-15 minute sessions.

It's very easy to get in to, has a pretty fun campaign, and still takes you to endgame play with relatively little time investment.

All of the classes are completely viable both in the beginning and in the end game. Many people have 1 of each class and share equipment across their toons.
Each class plays differently of each other. And you can spice it up with multiple different builds that all alter how you approach the fights!

The core goal of the gameplay is that you level a character to 70 and then grind the best loot possible.

There's two modes, a story and an adventure mode. The adventure mode let's you go anywhere.
