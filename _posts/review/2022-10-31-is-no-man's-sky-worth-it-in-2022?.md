It’s been a couple years since the highly anticipated NMS’ launch. The fan reception of the game at launch was horrible. Since then many updates, dlc’s, and modifications have come to the game free of charge which have turned it into a pretty good game, changing the early reception into a positive one. The game is definitely worth it at this point.

### Is No Man’s Sky the game for you?
Do you enjoy exploring multi galaxies, building, and earning? Do you like fighting giant robots? Fighting pirates, being a pirate? Upgrading your own machinery? Then this game is definitely for you.
The game lets you do whatever you want at any point that you want.

Exploring, gathering and building are key components to the game, a very minecraft gameplay feel (but with a lot more content than MC). In the game you can explore massive galaxies with each of them being unique.

You can build your own fleet, upgrade your machinery and create big farms to earn for you. Build and upgrade your own base!

There’s multiple difficulty modes, “Creative” where you can kick your feet up and build without threats, “Normal” and “Permadeath” being the most difficult mode.

The game’s community is big, nice and very respectful. 

If you like a structured game, then this game may not be for you. The game has a very open world do whatever you want approach. At times it feels quite grindy.
