Garry's Mod, or GMod for short, is a sandbox game that allows players to create and manipulate objects in a virtual world. Players can use a variety of tools and objects to create anything they can imagine, from simple contraptions to complex machinery. Garry's Mod does not have a specific goal or objective, giving players the freedom to create whatever they want and play how they want.

### GMod modding
GMod has an insanely big modding community.  You have thousands of workshop items that add content from other games such as maps, npcs and props. Ranging from Minecraft to Call of Duty.

### Is Garry's Mod dead?
GMod is definitely not dead. It may not be as good as in it's earlier glory days it still averages around 20,000 players per day.

### Conclusion
There's a limitless amount of content to engage with even if the playerbase isn't as large as it was in 2013 and 2014. The game is definitely worth getting if you are going to play it with friends, public servers can be a bit hit and miss.
